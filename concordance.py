"""
1. Begin (startApp()) will be main loop
2. Ask for textfile name (readInput()) should handle errors/reprompt
3. Return from readInput() and begin building a list of words (buildList()) using unsorted array
4. Return from buildList(), pass into sorting algorithm
5. Build a list in the following format: Word #oftimesappeared (buildList())
6. Write the output of buildList() to file named: WordCounts.txt, overwrite if exists/create new if not exist (writeListToFile())
7. Display bargraph of read in data. Resolve ties (displayGraphic())
